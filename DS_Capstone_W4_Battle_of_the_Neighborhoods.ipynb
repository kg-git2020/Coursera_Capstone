    "Toronto is the largest and the most populous city in Canada, with a population of nearly 3 million people. It is one of the most diverse and multicultural metropolitan areas in the world. It is also one of Canada's leading tourism destinations and has a rich cultural life. In 2017, the Toronto-area received 44 million tourists, of whom over 10 million were domestic visitors and 3 million were from the United States, spending a total of $8.84 billion. \n",
    "\n",
    "As is generally the case with such cities, Toronto has a rich food culture that includes a vast array of international cuisines influenced by the city's diverse demographics. It is home to tens of thousands of restaurants and several hundreds of thousands of independent as well as chain coffee shops, bakeries, food stores, etc.  \n",
    "As such, when tourists make plans to visit Toronto or new residents from different parts of Canada or immigrants from other countries plan their moves to Toronto, there is quite a lot of research material available with regards to popular food and tourist destinations. However, some of the other venues that are an integral part of people’s day-to-day lives receive less focus and attention. Some examples of these are pet stores, local outdoor recreation facilities, fitness centers, to name a few. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, this project will attempt to identify top local venues in four preselected venue categories, i.e., fitness, pets, outdoor recreation, and transportation. It will exclude restaurants and other food-related venues returned as a part of the venue analysis, as this data is not relevant to the problem statement being addressed by this project. Additionally, it will limit the number of boroughs and/or neighborhoods that will be considered in scope, to run a practical and meaningful analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will utilize data science tools to analyze Toronto neighborhood data and venue data from Foursquare API, and focus on four venue types listed above, and will aim to determine the presence and distribution of venues of these four types across the neighborhoods of Toronto.  \n"

The project aims to solve this problem by leveraging data on Toronto neighborhood venues, their types, frequencies, etc., thus, providing beneficial information to people looking for a unique experience in a large and diverse city, such as Toronto."
